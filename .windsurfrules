I am using Godot 4.4 Beta4 to create a VR/AR game using OpenXR for the meta quest 3/3S
Alway search for Godot docs online as you have limited knowledge on gdscript `.gd` files. 
Docs are available at: https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/
Avoid documentation that is outdated or not for version 4.4
DO NOT EDIT `.tscn` scene files, they need to be edited in the Godot editor

I am using the following plugins to make working in VR/AR in Godot easier:
 - `Godot OpenXR Vendors plugin`: https://godotvr.github.io/godot_openxr_vendors/index.html
 - `Godot OpenXR Tools`: https://godotvr.github.io/godot-xr-tools/docs/home/

 Search the folder "Godot Docs" for the docs for these plugins instead of going to the web.

# OpenXR Vendor Plugin Features

## Passthrough Functionality
The OpenXR Vendor plugin provides extensive passthrough capabilities through several key components:

1. `OpenXRFbPassthroughExtensionWrapper`:
   - Handles basic passthrough functionality
   - Supports automatic passthrough activation when environment blend mode is set to alpha blend
   - Features customizable passthrough settings:
     - Color mapping and filtering options
     - Edge detection with customizable colors
     - Opacity control
     - Support for color Look-Up Tables (LUTs)

2. `OpenXRFbPassthroughGeometry`:
   - Allows controlling where passthrough is rendered in the scene
   - Can be used to create specific passthrough areas or windows

3. `OpenXRMetaPassthroughColorLut`:
   - Enables color correction and filtering of passthrough imagery
   - Supports custom color grading through Look-Up Tables

## Scene Understanding
The plugin provides scene understanding capabilities through:

1. `OpenXRFbSceneManager`:
   - Manages Meta's Scene Understanding features
   - Automatically creates scene anchors when an OpenXR session starts
   - Allows registration of scenes to be instantiated for discovered anchors
   - Each scene anchor is added as a child of an XRAnchor3D node for proper positioning

2. `OpenXRFbSpatialEntity` and `OpenXRFbSpatialAnchorManager`:
   - Handle spatial anchors and persistent locations in the physical space
   - Enable tracking and persistence of virtual objects in the real world
   - Allow for saving and loading spatial anchors between sessions

These components are specifically designed for Meta Quest devices and provide the foundation for creating mixed reality experiences with proper scene understanding and passthrough capabilities.
